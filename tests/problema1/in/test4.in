appendix C is   a concise summary of the changes from the original version
an enumeration is a list
of constant          integer values
C does not  provide any operators for processing an entire string of characters as a unit
in malloc the requested size in characters is rounded up to the proper number of header-sized units
this is     either between two existing blocks or at the end of the list
the code for       each statement is either a single statement
or a group of                   them in braces
writing floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral values
emphasizes their      floating-point nature for human readers
float single-precision floating point
this operator   cannot be applied to a float     or       double\
this algorithm is a hash-search
typedef       int length makes the name length a synonym   for    int
for     the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf
if the string   is   to be found anywhere it will be in the list        of blocks beginning there
adjacent string literals are concatenated into a single string
a string     literal also called    a string    constant is    a sequence of   characters
surrounded by double quotes
strcpy is a function returning int   with two arguments  the first a character pointer and the
second a pointer to constant characters
for       each loops are not appropriate when you want to modify        the array
it                   would                   be more
precise to enclose the   initializers for     each row
or                  structure                 in braces
