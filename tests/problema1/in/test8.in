The for loop assigns a variable to successive items in     a sequence  and
executes                 one or more statements for each item
In our     first example
for instance      we  ll assign the name x to e  ach of the three items in a list in
turn   from left to right  and the print statement will be executed   for    each
this for bla      each is not going to  woooooooork
We used the    string split method here to chop up the line on its comma delimiters
the result is a list   of substrings containing the         individual numbers
In general            leading
and trailing     double underscores is the naming pattern   Python uses for implementation
details    The names without the underscores in this list are the callable methods on string objects
Uses a variable named x  created when it s assigned  to hold onto a string      object
James Gosling initiated Java language project in June 1991 for use in one of his many settop box 
projects The language initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside
Gosling s office also went by the name Green and ended up later being renamed as Java
from a list                     of random words
Interfaces work well  but they do have some limitations The big drawback is
that you must write the code for   each method that an interface declares
The curly braces are used when multiple statements need to
take place for                     each option
The while    and do-while loops perform the same  function The only difference
is that the while loop verifies the expression before executing the statement   and
the do-while     loop verifies the expression after executing the statement  This is   a
major  difference that can   be extremely helpful if   used properly
When used,the Java access specifiers public protected,   and private
are placed in front of each definition for each member in your class,
whether itâ€™s a field or a method. Each access specifier controls the access
for only that particular definition.
However blank finals provide much more flexibility in         the use of the
final keyword since  for example    a final field inside a class can now be
different for      each object and yet it retains   its immutable quality Here s an example
This works  but there s a major drawback  You must write type-specific
methods for      each new Instrument class you add  This means more
programming in                       the first place
The only reason to establish this common interface is so it can be
expressed differently for     each different subtype It establishes a basic
form  so you can say what s in     common with all the derived classes
You might think that there should be a specialized type      of
ArrayList for    each of the primitive data types   but Java doesn t provide
this for you. Some sort of templatizing mechanism might someday
provide a         better way for Java to handle this problem
Because code needs to be created for    Each primitive type as      well as
Object     there     s a lot of      nearly duplicated code
The following code establishes an inner base class to use as a test framework  then creates an
array of anonymous inner classes one for       each different test
for      each string being analyzed a while     loop is entered and tokens    are
pulled off the                  string
The source code package for this book provides an HTML         page for     each of
the applets in this book     and thus many    examples of the applet tag
modify SlowMap so that instead of two AarrayLists it holds a
single arraylist        of                  MPair objects
The exception   specification uses an additional keyword     throws followed
by a list               of all the potential exception types
This will catch any exception  so if you use it you ll want to put it at the
end of your list      of handlers to avoid preempting any exception handlers
that might                   otherwise follow it
However the String
object that s was pointing to is still occupying memory  In this bit of code
there is no way to access the object because the only reference to it is    out
of scope   In later chapters you   ll see how the reference to the object can be
passed     around and duplicated during the     course of a program
The type of the reference must be correct however If the argument is supposed to be a
String             what you pass in must be a string
Consider          a method that takes a string as its      argument
Note that a boolean value is    automatically converted to an appropriate
text form  if it s used where a      string is expected
the compiler normally takes exponential numbers as doubles           so without
the trailing f      it will give you an error telling you     that you must use a cast
to convert                   double to float
The interface keyword takes the concept of an abstract class one step
further by preventing any function definitions at all    The interface is           a
very     handy and commonly used tool   as it provides the      perfect separation
of interface and implementation   In addition     you can combine many
interfaces     together   if you wish    whereas inheriting from multiple regular
classes or                abstract classes is       not possible
The second approach is   to create objects dynamically in   a pool of memory
called     the heap  In this approach    you don   t know until run-time how
many objects you    need     what their lifetime is    or what their exact type is
Those are     determined at the spur of the    moment while the program is running
Once a class has been created and tested    it should     represent a
useful    unit of code    It turns out that this reusability is    not nearly so easy to
achieve       as many would hope   it takes experience and insight to produce a
good design      But once you have such a design   it begs to be reused   Code
reuse is     one of the greatest    advantages that object-oriented   programming
languages            provide
I see Java in    this same way   as an attempt to elevate            the programmer
away from           an operating-system mechanic and         toward being a software
craftsman
If you           re really into slimming
down      there are actually Palm Pilot   versions of the         book floating around
