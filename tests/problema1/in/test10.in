The examples we have seen so far are quite simple but lock management is 
really hard and full of pitfalls The most infamous
of them is deadlock a situation in which two or more competing 
threads are waiting for       each other to proceed and thus neither
ever does so Deadlocks usually occur when more than one lock or monitor 
lock are involved   JVM often is able to detect the
deadlocks in the running applications and warn the developers
When a function is        called an argument of the same type as   the parameter must be
passed to       the function For       each parameter
When an       object containing member objects is initialized    multiple constructor calls are
to be executed     One of these is     the constructor for the complete object      and the others
are constructors    for the member objects   The order of the constructor calls is significant in
this case   First the member objects are created and initialized    this then allows the 
constructor to create    the whole object Unless otherwise stated   the default constructor will
be called        for                 Each member object
Floating-point constants     are of type    double by default     However     you can add F or f
to designate     the sfloat type     or add L or l for the long     doubles type
This leads to implicit conversion  of the value of size to short and the integer     77 to double
Please note    however       that the leading spaces in    the second line will be evaluated 
as part   of the string    It is thus generally preferable to use the    first method
that is           to terminate    the string with     and reopen it    with
These include            stream classes                   for
input and output          but also classes for representing    strings or handling error conditions
Accuracy is   expressed in decimal places    This means that        six decimal places   allows a
programmer     to store two floating-point     numbers that differ within the first six decimal
places as separate numbers
The int     integer      type is tailor-made for computers             and adapts
to the              length of a register on the computer
The    pointer vekPtr will then reference the first         of a total of cnt array elements
vekPtr has        to be a pointer to Type for this reason
