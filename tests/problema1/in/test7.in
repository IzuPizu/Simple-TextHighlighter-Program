for      example a mailing-list module might contain a list     of
names and addresses along with a subroutine for adding a new name a subroutine for printing
mailing labels                     and so forth
A mailing list object      for example     has a state consisting
of a list      of names and addresses
An enum is   a type that has a fixed list  fof possible values which is specified when the enum
is                  created
Consider the list of                   numeric types
byte     short     int long floatdouble
A value of a type             that occurs earlier in 
this list can be converted automatically to a value that
occurs        later
This program reads a line        of text entered by the user
It prints a list      of the letters that occur in the text
and it reports how many different             letters were found
Get a positive integer     N      from the user
Let divisorCount be              0
for each number testDivisor in the range from 1 to N
if testDivisor             is a divisor of N
Count it by           adding 1 to divisorCount
Output           the count
for             beach      item in the sequence
if the      item passes the test
process it
for          each letter of the alphabet
if the                     letter occurs in str
Print           the letter
Add                            1 to count
Output              the count
For each line       read and ignore characters up to the colon
The primitive types are named
byte short int long float double char and boolean
The float and double types hold real numbers
A         double takes up 8 bytes
The coverage of graphical user interface programming has been reorganized, much of it has
been rewritten and new material has been added
A class can implement an    interface by providing an implementation for    each      of
the methods               specified by the interface
The value of the variable is an object belonging to the enumerated type class          There
is    one such object for   each enumerated type constant
and these are the only objects of the
class     that can ever be created   It is really these objects that represent
the possible values of
the enumerated type   The enumerated type constants are actually
variables that                             refer to these objects
For               each row of the board
for each column of the board
if       one of the player    s pieces is at this location
if it                is legal to jump to row 2 column 2
add this                 move to moves
Start with              an empty stack
for              each item in the expression
if the item                               is a number
Push the               number onto the stack
else            if the item is an operator
Pop the operands      from the stack             Can generate an error
Apply              the operator to the operands
Push the result onto the stack
else
There              is an error in the expression
Pop a number from the stack             Can generate an error
if the      stack is not empty
There is an error in the expression
else
The last number that was      popped is the value of the expression
for example a mailing-list module might contain a list 
of   names and addresses along with a subroutine for adding a new name   a subroutine for printing
mailing labels   and so forth   In such modules  the data itself is often hidden inside the module
a program that uses the module can then manipulate the data only indirectly    by calling the
subroutines provided by the module  This protects the data       since it can only be manipulated
in known      well-defined ways
