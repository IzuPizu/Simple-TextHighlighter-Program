One common situation is to use typedef names for various integer quantities then make an
                     __                      ___                                        
appropriate   set of choices of short   int  and long  for           each host machine
                                        ___            __________________             
It may be possible to cope with even bigger numbers by using a double
                                                               ______
One method of communicating data between functions is    for   the calling function to provide a
                                                   __    ___                                    
list            of values called arguments to the function   it calls
__________________                                                   
The parentheses after the function   name surround the argument list
                                                                    
As before all examples have been tested directly from the text which is in machine-readable
                                                 ____                __ __

___________                                                  
this is the purpose of the         while           loop
